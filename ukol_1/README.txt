====Missionaries and cannibals problem solver===
The program can be run by typing the following command into the operating
system’s terminal (Python 2.7 has to be installed on the system):

python run.py <number of cannibals> <search type>

The first parameter can be 2, 3 or 4 and the second BFS or DFS.

Example for a default behaviour (if no arguments are entered):
python run.py 3 BFS
